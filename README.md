## Intro
Master's project in MechE @ SJSU | Mobile robot for occluded object detection using Tensorflow &amp; Kalman Filters (Linear & Nonlinear)

This idea is already implemented/published in a few other papers

This code is meant to run on a mobile robot with an Intel Realsense and Jetson Nano. There's a couple other libraries and files that are missing (for now). This repo is just to add visibility to my work and it's not a tutorial (yet) of any kind.
